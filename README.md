# kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It abstracts away many complexities of managing containers and provides tools for maintaining the desired state of your applications.

Kubernetes architecture consists of several key components that work together to achieve its objectives:

1) **API Server:** This is the entry point for your requests, acting like an interface where you interact with Kubernetes. Using the Kubernetes API, you communicate your intentions, such as launching or scaling containers.

2) **Controller Manager:** Consider this the operations overseer. It maintains the desired state of your applications by running various control loops. If something goes off track, the controller manager adjusts it.

3) **Scheduler:** Visualize this as a manager allocating tasks to team members. It evaluates available resources and requirements, then intelligently assigns containers to suitable worker nodes, ensuring balanced workloads.

4) **etcd:** Think of this as the memory bank of Kubernetes. It's a distributed key-value store where critical data, configurations, and the real-time state of the cluster are stored. All nodes read from and write to etcd to stay coordinated.

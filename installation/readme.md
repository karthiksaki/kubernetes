Kops (short for Kubernetes Operations) is a command-line tool used for deploying, managing, and operating Kubernetes clusters on various cloud platforms or on-premises infrastructure. It was primarily designed for simplifying the process of setting up and maintaining production-ready Kubernetes clusters.

Kops enables users to create, update, and delete Kubernetes clusters in a declarative manner, typically by defining a cluster specification in a YAML file. This specification includes details about the desired cluster configuration, such as the number of nodes, instance types, network settings, and more. Kops then uses this specification to provision and configure the necessary resources in the chosen cloud provider or infrastructure.

## Key features and capabilities of Kops include:

**Cluster Lifecycle Management**: Kops helps with the entire lifecycle of a Kubernetes cluster, from provisioning and scaling to upgrading and decommissioning.

**High Availability:** Kops supports creating highly available clusters by deploying master nodes across multiple availability zones, which helps ensure that the control plane remains operational even in the case of hardware or network failures.

**Cluster Upgrades:** Kops simplifies the process of upgrading Kubernetes clusters to newer versions by providing commands and workflows for safely performing version upgrades.

**Integration with Cloud Providers:** Kops supports various cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and more. It integrates with the respective APIs to provision resources like virtual machines, load balancers, and storage.

**Customization:** Users can customize various aspects of the cluster's configuration, such as networking, security, instance types, and more, by modifying the cluster specification.

**Terraform Integration:** Kops can be used in conjunction with Terraform to manage the underlying infrastructure resources, providing a more flexible and customizable way of managing the infrastructure.

**Kubernetes Installation Using KOPS on EC2**
Create an EC2 instance or use your personal laptop.
Dependencies required

Python3
AWS CLI
kubectl

**Install dependencies**

curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip apt-transport-https kubectl
pip3 install awscli --upgrade
export PATH="$PATH:/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/"

**Install KOPS (our hero for today)**

curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64
chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops

**Provide the below permissions to your IAM user. If you are using the admin user, the below permissions are available by default**

AmazonEC2FullAccess
AmazonS3FullAccess
IAMFullAccess
AmazonVPCFullAccess

**Set up AWS CLI configuration on your EC2 Instance or Laptop.**
Run aws configure

Kubernetes Cluster Installation
**Please follow the steps carefully and read each command before executing**.

**Create S3 bucket for storing the KOPS objects.**
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket kops-abhi-storage --region us-east-1
**Create the cluster**
kops create cluster --name=demok8scluster.k8s.local --state=s3://kops-abhi-storage --zones=us-east-1a --node-count=1 --node-size=t2.micro --master-size=t2.micro  --master-volume-size=8 --node-volume-size=8
**Important: Edit the configuration as there are multiple resources created which won't fall into the free tier.**
kops edit cluster myfirstcluster.k8s.local
**Step 12: Build the cluster**

kops update cluster demok8scluster.k8s.local --yes --state=s3://kops-abhi-storage
This will take a few minutes to create............

**After a few mins, run the below command to verify the cluster installation.**

kops validate cluster demok8scluster.k8s.local
